To take the skills learned over the last two years and take on an extensive project where the finished product should reflect the candidate's general development capabilities, in addition to visual and technical skills.

## Description

For this assignment you have the choice between getting a real world client that you will manage and build a website for, or a case study to make a hotel booking website.

Whatever project you choose, the final submission must have the following:

- A Gantt chart planning the project
- A style guide
- An Adobe XD prototype
- Use a CSS Pre-processor and BEM if not using CSS Modules, Styled Components, etc
- Use a React.js or Next.js
- You can use regular JS or TypeScript
- Please use create-react-app or create-next-app to generate a skeleton project for yourself
- A fully working website that fulfils the brief

Make a website or application for a real world client. The project should offer a significant enough scope to be able to show off your skills as a developer, and hopefully the project can form a central part of your portfolio for when you start applying for jobs.

The process followed for the project will differ depending on the client and the requirements of their project.

Note: The project has to have a big enough scope to show off the skills learned over your studies. An example of the level we’re expecting would be a website where administrators can add, update, remove products, and users can search, filter, and contact administrators. If you are unsure if your potential client’s brief is strong enough for the Project Exam 2, please message your tutors. Use of a JavaScript Framework is a requirement.
